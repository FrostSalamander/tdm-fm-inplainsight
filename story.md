# In Plain Sight

# Game Flow

## Intro
September, 1627.

You are in the employ of the Crown as an intelligence officer. Word of an uprising has reached your superiors and you have been dispatched to <town name> to investigate a possible source of the plot.

Your cover is <cover name>, a merchant from Bridgeport.  If you are found out, minimal investigation by the local watch will reveal your 'true' identity as a thief of some renown who is on the run from the Bridgeport City Watch and seeking to ply your trade out of town.  Your identity as a spy will go unnoticed.

Use your skills to investigate the town, looking for clues of the uprising.
